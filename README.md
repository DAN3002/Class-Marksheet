# Class Marksheet
A basic student marks management software, just a small project to practice Javascript :))

## Usage Scenarios
1. Input student name and scores, then press "Enter" button to insert data into the table. The average score will not be calculated immediately and will be displayed as "?".
2. Press the "Calculate Average Score" button to calculate the average of the three subjects (math, physics, and chemistry) for each student. The average score will replace the "?" in the "Average" column.
3. Press the "Determine Outstanding Students" button to highlight students with an average score >= 8.0 in red.
4. Press the "Sort by Average Score" button to sort the students by their average score in descending order.
